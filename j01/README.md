# Setting Up Users on the Nintendo Switch

By Nick Thompson 3/10/2023

In 1980 Nintendo released the very first handheld game console called the Game & Watch. There were 59 different versions and each of them contained a single game, a clock, and an alarm. The different games varied from Balloon Fight to Mario to The Legend of Zelda. It was the earliest Nintendo video game console to gain worldwide success.

After the success of the Game & Watch, Nintendo ended up creating several more handheld consoles that also seemed to do very well such as the Gameboy, the Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Pokemon Mini, the DS, DSI, 3DS, 2DS, and most recently the Switch and Switch OLED.

Since its release in 2017, the Nintendo Switch has been dominating the market and has been one of the top-selling handheld consoles of all time. With this, you would think that the UI would be fairly **intuitive**, however, I found that the task of adding a new user (this is the goal)  was more difficult than I would have expected. 

The first thing that appears after booting the system is the home screen. At the bottom of the screen, there is a dock that has various different options including Nintendo Switch Online, Messages, Shop, Album, Controller, Settings, and Power. Above that and in the middle of the screen are the various games and apps. In the top right corner of the screen, there’s the time, whether or not there’s wifi (if there is wifi, the strength), and the battery percentage. In the top left corner of the screen, there are any users that are on the console.

My first thought on adding a new user was to click on one of the existing users in the top left-hand corner of the screen, so I clicked on my user icon (the Yoshi with the blue background). It brings me to a new page titled Nick’s Page which has several sub-menus. The sub-menus are Profile, Friend List, Trending, Online Play Invites, Friend Suggestions, Add Friend, and User Settings. However, none of these menus have any options that allow you to add a new user.

This is a simple mistake and luckily it is one where the **error tolerance** is fairly high and easy to recover from because with the simple press of a button (the b button) you are able to easily able to travel back to the screen you were on before. The b button (as the back button) and the a button (as the accept button) are two functions that are easily **learned** and repeatedly used throughout the system 

Since my first attempt didn’t work, my next thought was to go to click the setting button on the bottom of the screen in the dock. Once the settings menu opens there are several options that you are able to choose from. Lo and behold one of those options is users. The user's page lists the users that are on the device, below that is the option to “Change Order” and below that option is “Add User” (the option we have been looking for), and finally below that near the bottom of the screen is the option to “Transfer Your User Data”.

I figured that the **“safe”** option would be to select the button that says “Add User”. From there a new screen will appear that allows two options “Create New User” and “Import User Data from Another Console”.

I’m trying to add a new user, so I clicked the add user button and was brought to a page where I get to select an icon from the 9 available options on the screen or I can press “More Options”.

I don’t like the options I’m given so I press the “More Options” button which allows me to pick a character from a variety of Nintendo games and the background that will be behind that character and a big button that says, “OK”.

After pressing the “OK” button you are bought to a screen where you are prompted to enter the name for the user. Once you have imputed the name for your user you can press the new button that says “OK” and once you have pressed that button the new user is created.
