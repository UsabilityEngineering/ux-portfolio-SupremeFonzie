# Setting Up Users on the Nintendo Switch

By Nick Thompson 5/15/2023

In 1980, Nintendo introduced the groundbreaking Game & Watch, marking their entry into the handheld game console market. There were 59 distinct versions of the Game & Watch, each featuring a single game, a clock, and an alarm. The games varied greatly from Zelda to Mario to Donkey Kong. However, the Game & Watch quickly gained global popularity as one of the earliest handheld consoles to achieve widespread success.

Building on this triumph, Nintendo went on to develop a series of highly successful handheld consoles, including the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Pokemon Mini, DS, DSi, 3DS, 2DS, and most recently the Switch and Switch OLED.

Since its launch in 2017, the Nintendo Switch has emerged as a dominant force in the market, attaining astounding sales figures and it quickly became one of the top-selling handheld consoles of all time. Despite its popularity, however, I encountered unexpected challenges when trying to add a user to the device (the task). A process that did not match my preconceived **mental model** and caused much difficulty when it comes to **learnability**.  

Upon booting up the system, the home screen displays a dock at the bottom that presents a range of options such as Nintendo Switch Online, Messages, Shop, Album, Controller, Settings, and Power. Positioned in the center of the screen there are various games and applications, while the top right corner showcases the time, wifi connectivity status (including signal strength if connected), and battery percentage. The top left corner indicates the currently logged-in users on the console.

Although this turned out to be a minor oversight, the system's **error tolerance** was sufficiently high, allowing for me to easily recover. By simply pressing the "b" button (which is designated as the back button) I was promptly returned to the previous screen. The familiarity and frequent use of the "b" button as the back button and the "a" button as the accept button contribute to these functions becoming easily used throughout the system.

Although this turned out to be a minor oversight, the system's **error tolerance** was sufficiently high, allowing for me to easily **recover**. By simply pressing the "b" button (which is designated as the back button) I was promptly returned to the previous screen. The familiarity and frequent use of the "b" button as the back button and the "a" button as the accept button contribute to these functions becoming easily learned and repeated throughout the system.

With my initial setback, I decided to lick my wounds and carry on and try to access the settings menu by selecting the settings button located at the bottom of the screen (in the dock). Upon accessing the settings menu, a variety of options became available. To my satisfaction, one of the options included a dedicated "Users" section. After opening the user management page, I discovered a list of existing users on the device. Located below the user list was the long-awaited "Add User" option, preceded by the option to "Change Order." Towards the bottom of the screen, an additional option to "Transfer Your User Data" was also visible.

Considering that the "Add User" option is what I have been looking for, I selected it (deciding it would be the **safest** choice) which prompted a new screen offering two choices: "Create New User" and "Import User Data from Another Console."

Since my objective was to add a new user, I proceeded to click the "Add User" button, which directed me to a page where I could choose an icon from a selection of 9 available options displayed on the screen. Alternatively, I could explore additional choices by selecting "More Options."

Finding the initially presented options not to my liking, I pressed the "More Options" button, granting access to a wider range of characters from various Nintendo games, along with the option to select a background for the chosen character. After I picked my choices the "OK" button was available to confirm the selection.

Upon pressing the "OK" button, I was directed to a screen where I was prompted to enter the name of the new user. After inputting the userâ€™s name (which was user), I proceeded to press the "OK" button once again, finally creating a new user.
