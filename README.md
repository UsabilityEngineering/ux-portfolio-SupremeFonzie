Hello, my name is Nick Thompson and I'm a transfer student from Ventura College and currently a junior. I got my AA in Behavioral Science and I'm currently going for my Bachelor's of engineering in Computer Information Systems as well as minoring in Buisness Adminastration. I was pre-law before coming to chico but decided to change my major. I love to build computers and watch techie videos from channels like Linus Tech Tips and Marques Brownlee. I also love to play video games. If I'm not doing either one of those you can usually find me eating, sleeping, or hanging out with my girlfriend.
